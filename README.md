# HEXZD FYSC - Open Source Project
This is a open-sourced project for HEXZD FYSC, this can be used for everyone to use it for their seasons in FYSC.

# How to run FYSC?
⁠•⁠ Extract the files using WinRAR or 7Zip.
⁠•⁠ Open the terminal and locate the file directory in the file where you extracted from.
⁠•⁠ Install the required node module files from *npm* using the command: "npm i" before you run the files. (If node_modules doesn't install (depends for your router, if executed from the terminal), we have a pre-loaded zip file that can be extracted for you.)
• After you install the required module files for node.js, run "npm start".
• And there you have it, the port for the file that you run via localhost is 5555 or 3333, check "server.js" and look which port it was using.


# [IMPORTANT] REQUIRED FILES IN ORDER
⁠•⁠ Node.js V18.2.0 or above
